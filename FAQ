development environment that works

1.
    1. nix stdenv = gcc12Stdenv    (see mkderivation.nix)
    2. baseInputs has gcc          (but probably doesn't need it)
    3. devInputs has llvmPackages_16.clang-unwrapped

    This leads to env with
      CC=gcc
      CXX=g++
      NIX_CC=/nix/store/$hash-gcc-wrapper-12.3.0

    To build,  need to tell cmake to use gcc:
      cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which g++) -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which gcc) path/to/src
